I have developed over 10 solid projects with JavaScript. These include a real-time weather app, an image generator with OpenAI's API, a Pac-Man game, and many more.

                <p>After I finished my diploma in programming with Python, I thought I was the guy until one of my friends challenged me to write a script that would make it easier for her to write to a spreadsheet. I spent eight hours a day for two weeks trying to figure the code out. I would write and rewrite the code with no success until I applied one concept I learned in school: break a problem into small parts and tackle it one by one. I developed precise functions to tackle different problems. I wrote a function that would handle file parsing, and after over 400 lines of code, I had completed the project. Mainly named Excel Made Easier, it is software in which you can edit, write, delete, update, and choose a file system and format in which you want the data to be output. You can also edit existing files. Oh, and my friend never paid me.</p>

The project utilized advanced machine learning algorithms to achieve real-time face detection, creating a mesh overlay for facial landmarks, and tracking the full body and hands. The face detection component identifies faces in an image or video, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces. The face mesh feature goes a step further, mapping detailed facial landmarks to capture expressions and facial movements. The full body tracking system detects and tracks the human body, recognizing and following its movements. Hand tracking focuses on detecting and tracking hand movements and gestures. </p>

                <p>Facial detection using Haar cascades in Python is a beginner-friendly artificial intelligence project. Essentially, it's about using machine learning techniques to teach a computer to recognize faces in images or videos. The Haar cascades method helps in detecting specific patterns that make up a face, like the arrangement of eyes, nose, and mouth. By collecting and analyzing data, the program learns to identify these patterns, making it capable of automatically spotting faces in photos or live streams. It's a foundational project that introduces key concepts like data collection, training models, and applying them to real-world tasks, all while using a popular programming language like Python.</p>

                  <p>After I finished my diploma in programming with Python, I thought I was the guy until one of my friends challenged me to write a script that would make it easier for her to write to a spreadsheet. I spent eight hours a day for two weeks trying to figure the code out. I would write and rewrite the code with no success until I applied one concept I learned in school: break a problem into small parts and tackle it one by one. I developed precise functions to tackle different problems. I wrote a function that would handle file parsing, and after over 400 lines of code, I had completed the project. Mainly named Excel Made Easier, it is software in which you can edit, write, delete, update, and choose a file system and format in which you want the data to be output. You can also edit existing files. Oh, and my friend never paid me.</p>

                <p>For my final project after completing my learning journey, I developed an integrated solution that automates the process of billing and inventory management at a supermarket using C++. This supermarket billing system streamlines the checkout process by leveraging a point-of-sale (POS) terminal that includes real-time inventory updates, and automated billing calculations. The system accurately retrieves product information, applies discounts, processes various payment methods, and generates detailed receipts for customers. Additionally, it features robust inventory management capabilities, ensuring stock levels are updated instantly with each transaction. This project not only reinforced my understanding of C++ but also highlighted its application in creating efficient and reliable software solutions for real-world business needs.

              <p>For my first back-end project using Django, I created "Study-Bud," a modern platform designed for developers to collaborate on various topics and projects. Utilizing Django's robust framework, I built features that allow users to create profiles, join discussion groups, post updates, and share resources. The platform supports real-time interactions, project management tools, and topic-based forums, making it easy for developers to connect and collaborate effectively. This project not only deepened my understanding of back-end development but also showcased Django's capabilities in building secure, scalable, and interactive web applications, paving the way for future full-stack development projects. I implemented database models to manage user data, discussion threads, and project details efficiently. By leveraging Django's powerful ORM, I facilitated seamless data retrieval and manipulation, enhancing the platform's functionality.
